Subject: Firebase Storage 412 Error - Service Account Permissions Not Working After 8+ Hours

Hello Firebase Team,

I'm experiencing a persistent HTTP 412 error when trying to load images from Firebase Storage. Despite assigning the correct IAM role, the issue persists after 8+ hours.

PROJECT INFORMATION:
- Project Name: universal-distribucion
- Project ID: universal-distribucion
- Project Number: 70473962578
- Storage Bucket: universal-distribucion.firebasestorage.app

ERROR:
HTTP request failed, statusCode: 412
Error message: "A required service account is missing necessary permissions. Please resolve by visiting the Storage page of the Firebase Console and re-linking your Firebase bucket"

WHAT I'VE TRIED:
1. ✅ Assigned "Cloud Storage for Firebase Service Agent" role (roles/firebasestorage.serviceAgent) to:
   service-70473962578@gcp-sa-firebasestorage.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   - Verified in Google Cloud Console IAM that the role is correctly assigned
   - Even tried assigning "Owner" role - still doesn't work

2. ✅ Storage rules configured with `allow read: if true` for public read access

3. ✅ Waited 8+ hours for IAM permission propagation

4. ✅ Verified billing is active

5. ✅ Attempted to regenerate download URLs using getDownloadURL() and getData() - both fail with 412 error

IMPACT:
- Previously uploaded images cannot be displayed in the app
- Users cannot see product images
- Core app functionality is affected

ERROR LOGS:
```
══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY IMAGE RESOURCE SERVICE ╞════════════════════════════════════════════════════
HTTP request failed, statusCode: 412,
https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/universal-distribucion.firebasestorage.app/o/uploads%2F...
```

QUESTION:
Is there a way to re-link the Storage bucket as suggested in the error message? I cannot find this option in Firebase Console. Also, is it normal for IAM permissions to take more than 8 hours to propagate?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
